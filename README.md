These are the steps:

  1. Developer creates a PR with a card Id in the title - (10136774344)
  2. The reviewer will approve and merge the PR
  3. The corresponding card will move to ready for test, as long as it is not in a blocked status
  4. Doc cards will move to recently completed items

That's all folks!
